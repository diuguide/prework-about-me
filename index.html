      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Hello everyone, this is my first website!</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>Raleigh, North Carolina</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I am a huge fan of the outdoors, going to the beach, taking pictures, eating delicious food, and going to live music.  Most of those things are on hold right now because of the virus, recently I've been lucky to having coding to get into!</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>It is my dream to own my own company one day, whether in tech or a small two man food truck.  I really have an entrepreneurial spirit! Until then I just want a job I can enjoy.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I still live in Raleigh, used to work/live in the durham area.  Before that I was in the NC mountains in the Boone area for six years.  I love living in NC!</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>Coding seems like the best career oppurtunity, especially here in the triangle area.  We have a lot of tech companies in the area.  I am really interested in the solar field or any type of sustainable tech tied into coding and web developement.  I get the sense that all sorts of different companies have a need for people educated in coding so the oppurtunities and options are broad.</p>
